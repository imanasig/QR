/* 
   This is a placeholder for your logo.
   
   To add your actual logo:
   1. Save your logo as 'logo.png' in the static/ folder
   2. Use a square image (e.g., 500x500px) for best results
   3. PNG format with transparency works best
   4. The logo will be automatically centered on QR codes
   
   If this file doesn't exist, QR codes will still work - just without the logo overlay.
